AWS GenAI Automation Guide
Step-by-Step Implementation for SageMaker, Bedrock, Observability, and GitLab CI/CD Integration
1. Introduction
This document provides a detailed, step-by-step guide to automate provisioning, configuration, and
management of AWS AI/ML services such as Amazon SageMaker and Amazon Bedrock. It
explains how to integrate observability tools for monitoring GenAI workloads, build and maintain
GitLab CI/CD pipelines for infrastructure and application deployments, and ensure environment
consistency across Dev, QA, and Prod using configuration management.
2. Architecture Overview
The system is designed in multiple layers: 1nn GitLab – Source control and CI/CD orchestration.
2nn Terraform – Infrastructure provisioning for AWS resources. 3nn SageMaker – Model training,
registry, and deployment. 4nn Bedrock – GenAI model integration and inference. 5nn
Observability – CloudWatch, CloudTrail, and OpenSearch for metrics and logging. 6nn Security –
IAM, KMS, and Secrets Manager for governance and encryption.
Step 1: GitLab CI/CD Setup
Create a GitLab repository for IaC and ML code. Configure GitLab Runner with AWS OIDC to
assume roles securely. Define pipeline stages (init, plan, apply, build, deploy). Store Terraform and
Python scripts in the repo and use GitLab environment variables for AWS configuration.
Step 2: Terraform Infrastructure Automation
Use Terraform modules to create VPCs, IAM roles, S3 buckets, SageMaker domains, and
CloudWatch dashboards. Apply separate workspaces for Dev, QA, and Prod to ensure isolation
and consistency.
Step 3: SageMaker Training and Model Management
Upload data to S3 and training scripts to GitLab. Use SageMaker for training with built-in or custom
algorithms. Register trained models in the Model Registry and enable Model Monitor for drift
detection.
Step 4: Amazon Bedrock Integration
Provision Bedrock access via IAM roles. Integrate Bedrock foundation models (Claude, Titan, etc.)
for GenAI. Use Lambda/API Gateway to invoke Bedrock endpoints and monitor metrics in
CloudWatch.
Step 5: Observability & Monitoring
Configure CloudWatch for SageMaker metrics, CloudTrail for API audit, and OpenSearch for log
analysis. Set SNS/Slack alerts for failures or anomalies. Enable AWS Config and GuardDuty for
compliance monitoring.
Step 6: Security and Compliance
Use least-privilege IAM roles, encrypt data with KMS, manage credentials in Secrets Manager,
apply tagging policies, and enable VPC endpoints for SageMaker and S3 to block public access.
Step 7: Environment Consistency (Dev, QA, Prod)
Use Terraform workspaces per environment. Parameterize region/env variables in CI/CD pipelines.
Promote models across stages with approvals. Validate configurations pre-deployment for
consistency.
Step 8: Workflow Connectivity Summary
1. Developer commits ® GitLab triggers CI/CD. 2. GitLab Runner assumes IAM role (OIDC). 3.
Terraform provisions SageMaker, Bedrock, and monitoring stack. 4. SageMaker trains and
registers models in S3. 5. GitLab deploys endpoints or integrates Bedrock APIs. 6. CloudWatch and
CloudTrail capture metrics and logs. 7. IAM/KMS secure all data and operations.
4. Conclusion
This end-to-end automation framework ensures streamlined model deployment workflows for Data
Engineering and Security teams, enforcing governance and maintaining reliability. By combining
GitLab CI/CD, Terraform, and AWS native services like SageMaker and Bedrock, the organization
achieves a scalable, observable, and secure GenAI platform across environments.
